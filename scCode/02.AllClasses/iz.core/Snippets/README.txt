Arranges windows conveniently for work on the laptop, and presents a list of current Documents to switch between them. 

Can archive all currently open documents in the default global archive (archive.sctxar) and reload them from a list of saved sessions. 

Documents that contain comments in the format: 
//:<k> <comment> 
Cause the code to be divided internally in parts, where each part can be evaluated by typing the key in the comment: <k> 


Note: This is a rework of an excellent idea by Ronald J. Kuivila, from an alpha version of DocTop. It contains some modifications in design. Some features of DocTop were left out, while others were added instead, notably the code-snippet idea.
